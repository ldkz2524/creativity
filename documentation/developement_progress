Progress
----------
Feb 14, 2014
* SOAP library called, 'SUDS' is used
* Started to use web of science api using soap approach
* Got authentication and closeSession to work

Feb 18, 2014
* Attached session id to the header of search request
* Input parameters for search request has been made
* search request can now be made, but response has to be formatted
* First search returns the single work with the most number of citations (currently author hardcoded as Chomczynski, P)
* citingArticels receive input from previous search result and returns 5 works that cited the work returned by previous function
* made code cleaner and more objected-oriented like by creating 'Authenticate' and 'Query' class.
* as of now, program prints session id, most highly cited work of Chomczynski, P, 5 most highly cited works that cites the previous work of Chomczynski, P

Feb 19, 2014
* co-cited authors can be returned
* input author can be returned, so i've removed tuples with same input and output author
* different arguments for cocitation with function have been documented
* program will output co-cited authors with input author
* Feb 14, 2014 ~ Feb 19, 2014 GOAL DONE

Feb 25, 2014
* now input author is not hard coded and accepts it as an arugment
* settings is not hard coded and the file name of the settings file is accepted as an argument
* the sample settings file is described above as well as how command should look like

March 30, 2014
* Possible Graphical Representation library is being reviewed.
* Error caused by a return with unknown citedAuthor is fixed 
* Repeated co-citation is now removed, instead the output now shows the count of the same co-citation next to the input and the output author

March 31, 2014
* The return will be sorted by the number of co-citation (high to low) then the alphabetical order.
* The program saves an information about how two authors are related (which works of them and others make them co-cited)
* The return is saved into a csv file

April 3, 2014
* Recursive author co-citation search has been implemented
* There is a need for the program to remove duplicate and co-citation from the same paper
* Removing co-citation from the same paper has been implemented, but not fully debugged due to internet disconnection
* After reference duplicate removal is implemented, there is a need for large sample debugging

April 4, 2014 ~ April 5, 2014
* Reference duplicate (two or more same co-citation getting counted more than once) is now removed, when counting co-citation.
* Program functionality is somewhat complete, but details have to be checked out.
* Number of co-citation that each author is involved with is printed out in the second file

April 6, 2014
* All the csv output is in UTF-8 to prevent any error rising from unicode to ascii conversion. (due to authors with their name written in their native language, not in english alphabet)

May 12, 2014
* Location data is collected from Web of Science and they are saved to a list
* Database implementation has started

May 13, 2014
* Everything is correctly imported into sqlite database from query (author, work, authorWork, Cocitation, Address)
* tables are relatively simple, but storing more information is a piece of cake

May 15, 2014
* database now allows retrieval operations
* database macro operations have been added (cocitation_with, count_cocitation_with, cocitation_together, count_cocitation_together)

June 18, 2014
* different formats of names are now formatted to last_name,first_name_initial ex) BILDER,R
* email is retrieved and saved into the database

June 19, 2014
* number of work that each author published in given time frame is stored
* collection and editions are now set to be the entire WOS, not just SCI

June 20, 2014
* location and email now includes date information,so that the latest one can be tracked
* Queries that have been searched are now saved into a database

June 21 ~ 22, 2014
* Finalized all the functionalities
* Updated sample output file

June 23, 2014
* Finalized the program to remove insignificant data
* Updated biology output
